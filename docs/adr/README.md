# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the GFN Pipeline project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Understand why decisions were made
- Onboard new team members faster
- Avoid revisiting decisions without new information
- Document trade-offs explicitly
